Based on an Excel project from the Vehicle Dynamics module of my Motorsport Engineering degree.

Used to practice my JavaScript skills. In particular, processing user inputs through mathematical equations to give correct outputs.

Application can be compared to the original Excel file from my university project.

The purpose is for a user to input data regarding their vehicle and the output will tell the user how the weight is distributed across each of the tyre contact patches. This information allows Race Engineers to analyse the effects vehicle setup will have on the handling.
